# Simple Calculator

This Python script provides a basic command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo operations on two numbers.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
3.  **Navigate to the directory** where you saved the file.
4.  **Run the script:** Execute the script using the command `python calculator.py`.
5.  **Follow the prompts:**
    * Enter the first number when prompted.
    * Enter the second number when prompted.
    * Choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number (1-6) from the menu.
6.  **View the result:** The calculator will display the result of the chosen operation.

## Supported Operations

1.  **Addition:** Adds the two entered numbers.
2.  **Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first number.
3.  **Multiplication:** Multiplies the two entered numbers.
4.  **Division:** Divides the first number by the second number. Handles division by zero errors.
5.  **Power:** Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
6.  **Modulo:** Returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second number.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling for the following:

* **Invalid numeric input:** If the user enters non-numeric values for the numbers, an error message will be displayed.
* **Invalid choice:** If the user enters a choice outside the valid range (1-6), an error message will be displayed.
* **Division by zero:** If the user attempts to divide by zero, a "division by zero" message will be displayed.
